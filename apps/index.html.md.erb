In this section we'll talk about how to create and manage a [Fly App](/docs/reference/apps/).

A Fly App is a collection of one or more [Fly Machines](/docs/machines/) VMs. The `fly launch` and `fly deploy` commands let you manage an app's Machines as a group with a unified [configuration](/docs/reference/configuration/).

You can also configure and manage Machines atomically; see the [Fly Machines](/docs/machines/) docs.
