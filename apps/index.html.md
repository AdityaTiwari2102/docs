In this section we'll talk about how to create and manage a [Fly App](/docs/reference/apps/).

[Configure and deploy a new app](/docs/apps/launch/) with `fly launch`.

`fly deploy` creates and updates the app's [Fly Machines](/docs/machines/) as a group, creating a new app release.

You can also configure and manage Machines atomically; see the [Fly Machines](/docs/machines/) docs.
